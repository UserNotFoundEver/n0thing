<h1>NOTHING LOL</h1>

<p>Wait, what happened?</p>

<p>Smart contract wasn't very smart along with its entire eco system, we cannot support buggy products to professionals or failed funding to support other projects by promoting with our high ethical eco-system</p>

<h1>BRUH I WILL SUE YOU</h1>

<p>We don't deal with buggy code much less partner with other projects that were hacked on the same day, The ERC-20 Nothing meme has a high ethical standard</p>

<h1>What now? I'm a whale bro please what?!</h1>

<p>As an ally of xyz we have a stricter money policy and reputation than what you may think. We cannot provide financial advice as it was meme, however since there has been airdrops DYOR</p>

<h1>Ok ser but is this a rug?</h1>
<p>No, we don't have time for games, if you can get clever and cash out or just hold (NFA) then do as you wish this is out of my control besides a PSA. Again, the ERC's are fine but other contracts don't work and enough is enough</p>
